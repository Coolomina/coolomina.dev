I'm a Site Reliability Engineer doing geek stuff here and there.
**email**: coolomain[at]protonmail.com

#### What can I expect from this blog?
I want this to be a recap of software/infra engineering best practices I'm learning along the way.

#### Hey yo, that code freakin' SUCKS!
Please, keep the feedback constructive.

#### I have this problem, how do I solve it?
I don't do consulting, but if you give me one interesting topic to investigate, I'll try my best to write about it!
