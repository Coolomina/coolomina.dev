So... yep!, this is the first time for me writing public stuff on the Internet, where every person is nice to everyone trying to write engineering blog entries aimed to help people *(cough, cough...)*.

You know when they say that you improve the knowledge of something when you try to explain it to other people?, that's what I'm trying to achieve with this *blog*, or whatever you want to call it.

First blog entry will be about the internals of this blog and will include brief a introduction to [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
